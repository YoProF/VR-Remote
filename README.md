# VR-Remote
We're 4 students at Lule√• University of Technology, working on a project intended to map the real world into virtual reality.  The goal of the project is to create a virtual world that corresponds to the real world. And then map virtual and real interactions together, while integrating sensordata into the virtual world.   For an example people moving around in the real world could be represented by completely different virtual entities. While, actions in the virtual world should be reflected in the real world.  In practice the framework of this project could be used to provide humans in other remote control environments with more intuitive representations of sensordata and other information that's usually output in relatively abstract ways.
